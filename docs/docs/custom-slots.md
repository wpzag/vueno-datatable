# Custom Slots

::::card
Dynamic slots allow you to customize the content of a specific column in a table by defining a template for that column. You can use the template tag and bind it to an object containing the data for the current row being rendered. You can then access the data for the current row using the item object inside the template. This allows you to customize the content of the column for each row in the table.
